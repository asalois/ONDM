Monte Carlo simulation process

Use Mathematica to create a file of Linux commands

These Linux commands change the parameters of the matlab files (e.g., different segment lengths, effective areas, compensation percentages) using sed and launch batch jobs using sbatch
Here we use Mathematica as a text editor to automatically create multiple sed and sbatch commands
Mathematica writes the commands in a text file. We use MS word to edit the file and put semicolons every after command
Use sinfo | grep “idle” to find the idle nodes in all queues
We copy-paste the Linux commands from MS Word to 
Run multiple Scripts In Linux in parallel using nodes in the defq and the unsafe queue
Collect the launched batch job numbers into an excel file
Use squeue -u b91w319 | wc –l to monitor the progress of different jobs
sacct -S 2019-02-02 -u b91w319 | grep "COMPLETED" > completed.txt
sacct -S 2019-02-02 -u b91w319 | grep "CANCELLED" > cancelled.txt
squeue -u b91w319 >running.txt
See whether the jobs run or they were cancelled 
FindWhichBatchFilesRun.nb in C:\Users\b91w319\Documents\MSU\Calculs\QSMF_Luis
Rerun the jobs that were cancelled 
Move all text files into a single directory in Linux
Transfer txt.files form Linux to PC
Read the text files with Mathematica
Fit the results QvsP
Compare with the predictions of Poggiolini model for Q0 vs ls1
